# Business Plan using Lean Canvas Approach

In our commitment to fostering a lean and agile business strategy, we have adopted the Lean Canvas approach for our 1-page business plan. The Lean Canvas provides a concise and effective way to outline key aspects of our business model, focusing on essential elements such as customer segments, problem-solving, unique value propositions, and more.
