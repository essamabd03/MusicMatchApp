Observation 1
There are many young people (age group 16-24)
48 / 53 people (90.6%) said they were in the 16-24 age group
We should make an effort to appeal to a younger audience by focusing on things such as intelligent design, cutting edge features, and connections with friends

Observation 3
Many of the users utilize mobile devices
More than 85% utilize a mobile device when they listen to music
We could focus more of our development efforts on making the mobile application very user friendly and easy to navigate
