- Adoption: 
  - Download rate: Use Firebase Analytics to monitor the app installation events and count the number of new downloads.
  - Sign-up conversion rate: Capture the rate at which new downloads lead to new sign-ups by tracking authentication  events with Firebase Authentication.
  - Number of users trying the live discovery feature within the first week of app installation: Use a combination of  Firestore to store feature usage flags and Firebase Analytics to track the timeframe of usage post-installation.
- Task Success: 
  - Success rate of album rating task: Track the completion of album rating tasks through Firestore event logging,  identifying successful submissions and failures.
  - Average time to add an album to a playlist: Time-stamp the start and completion of adding an album using Firebase  Analytics, then calculate the average duration.
  - Error rate during task completion: Implement error tracking in the app's code that reports to Firebase Crashlytics, enabling us to monitor and reduce the error rate.
- Retention Rate
  - Take analytics of when a user signs up, and their last login, if more than an x amount of days since last login, user was not retained, else, user is retained. Retention rate is calculated by taking retained users divided     by total users within our backend database (Firebase)
- Session Length
  - We record the amount of time a user spends on the application in a session. To get average session length, get total sessions and total amount of time user has spent, then divide time by total sessions
- Error Rate
  - Take how many times a user presses on a button, and if an error occurs, record that. Take total errors and divide by the number of clicks to calculate the rate at which a user will face an error.
- NPS
  - When a user logs into the app, they will be presented with a question rating the app 0 -10 of if they would recommend the app. In the backend, we will use a cloud function to get this data and find out our Net Promoter Score. We will then store the scores in the database and send a message to the user thanking them for rating the application.
- User Rating
  - Metrics of user enjoyability within the usage of the app. User satisfaction surveys prompted randomly to users who have been using the app for at least a week. Measured with a 1-5 stars rating and stored in the backend.
- DAU
  - Utilize Google Analytics to measure how many unique users login to the app at least once in a given day. This can be tracked by adding one to a counter for every unique login on a given day and dividing that by the total number of users who have accounts within the app.
