**A/B Test Name:** Album/Song Rating Prompt

**User Story Number:** US6: Prompt to Rate Album/Song

**Metric** (from the HEART grid): Task Success

- **Hypothesis:** By getting users to interact more inside of our application (rating albums/songs) we will likely see a notable success in user interaction, thus fulfilling our Task Success and possibly retention rates.
- **Problem:** Users do not consistently rate albums/songs after listening to them, leading to a lack of feedback and potential missed opportunities for improving recommendations and user satisfaction.
- **Impact:** By increasing the rate of user feedback through prompt mechanisms, we can gather more data to improve our recommendation algorithms, enhance user satisfaction, and potentially increase user engagement with the platform.
- **Experiment:** To test the hypothesis, we will implement a prompt mechanism to encourage users to rate albums or songs after listening. The experiment will be conducted using Firebase capabilities to track user interactions and measure the success metrics accurately.
- **Variations:** The variation we will test involves displaying a modal prompt at the end of a listening session, asking the user to rate the album or song they just listened to. The prompt will include a star rating system and an optional text input for additional feedback.
