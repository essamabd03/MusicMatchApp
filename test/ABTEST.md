**A/B Test Name:** Album/Song Rating Prompt

**User Story Number:** US6: Prompt to Rate Album/Song

**Metric** (from the HEART grid): Task Success

- **Hypothesis:** By getting users to interact more inside of our application (rating albums/songs) we will likely see a notable success in user interaction, thus fulfilling our Task Success and possibly retention rates.
- **Problem:** Users do not consistently rate albums/songs after listening to them, leading to a lack of feedback and potential missed opportunities for improving recommendations and user satisfaction.
- **Impact:** By increasing the rate of user feedback through prompt mechanisms, we can gather more data to improve our recommendation algorithms, enhance user satisfaction, and potentially increase user engagement with the platform.
- **Experiment:** To test the hypothesis, we will implement a prompt mechanism to encourage users to rate albums or songs after listening. The experiment will be conducted using Firebase capabilities to track user interactions and measure the success metrics accurately.
- **Variations:** The variation we will test involves displaying a modal prompt at the end of a listening session, asking the user to rate the album or song they just listened to. The prompt will include a star rating system and an optional text input for additional feedback.

**A/B Test Name:** New App Features

**User Story Number:** US8: New App Features

**Metric** (from the HEART grid): User Rating

- **Hypothesis:** While our app has a decent amount of users, the engagement with the current features of the app are not as high as were initially thought. What this suggests is that there is a bottleneck when it comes to feature adoption. We believe that the features that are live now do not have the ability to keep the users engaged. To fix this issue, we think the best course of action is redesigning the features that are not being used by users daily and make it more user-friendly. With the use of user-rating, we can get an idea of what the current feature stands and then aim at achieving a higher score with the revamped feature. We believe that improving the user rating of the app's feature will lead to higher engagement and satisfaction.
- **Experiment:** For the experiment, instead of releasing the new features to all users, we will opt to send them out to just 50% of all users. The reason for a smaller release to a certain percentage of users is to get feedback before a wider release which will allow us to fine-tune the features. Also, we can monitor the performance to see how it responds and if there are any issues. For tracking, after a week of the new feature being out, it will ask the users to rate it 1 to 5, this being done through cloud functions in Google Firebase.
- **Variations:** The variation we will use is after a feature is launched and users have had access to it for about a week, they will have a message displayed on their screen asking them to rate the feature 1 to 5 of how much they like it.
